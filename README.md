# 201code
This 201code repo is for **201n15 class code.** I will update this project as we will be moving ahead.
It is going to be very ***interesting!***

## Contents
We will see how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to create, style and rend a website functionable and useful to users.
So in this project, we will see and discuss:
* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT.  

After we will see them on work, in a website that I intend to create and include all of what I will be learning.
___Thank you. Hope to see you ahead!___

As a developper, I would like to strech my skills by updating my site and make it "About Me" where i updated it with more information related to me. i have also added Top Ten List of My Favorite Gospel Songs at the bottom of the page including their youtube videos. ***See You Soon***

**17 Aug 2019**, Brett Packard forked the repo to begin work on Lab 04, pair programming
In today's lab, pair programming, as the driver I worked with James to move some lines of code into functions, and we also added some additional functionality. Two of the questions/games, 'guess my name' and 'guess my country', were turned into FOR loops, and defined three functions inside each of those loops. We also added a correct answer tally by creating a variable and a function at the beginning of app.js, and adding the function to both 'correct answer' functions. We utilized the tally by adding an IF statement at the end of the game, giving a different message depending on the tally, but always inviting the user to view the webpage.
